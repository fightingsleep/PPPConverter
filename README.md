# Purchasing Power Parity Salary Converter

Give it a try: https://www.chrislross.com/PPPConverter/

#### The motivation:

There only exists a few of these types of converters online, but they use static PPP data that is often outdated. This converter fetches the PPP data dynamically from [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) instead. This means that the data is always up to date, and can provide the best conversion possible.

#### Why PPP is useful:

The foreign exchange rate tells you that a salary of 80,000 Euros can be converted into 100,000 US Dollars. What it doesn't tell you is if 100,000 USD in America can get you the same standard of living as 80,000 Euros does in France. How much money would you need in America to buy the same things that you would buy in France?

This is where [Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) comes in. Converting your salary using PPP helps to give you a better approximation of what your standard of living would be like in two different countries. This can be handy to know if you're a remote worker who lives in London, but works for a company in Toronto (who pays you in CAD).
